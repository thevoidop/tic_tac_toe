# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. It can be played in single-player mode against the computer or in two-player mode.

## Features

- Single-player mode against a computer opponent.
- Two-player mode for playing with a friend.
- Colorful text output for a visually appealing interface.
- Error handling to ensure smooth gameplay.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script `tic_tac_toe.py`.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose the game mode:
   - Enter `1` for single-player mode.
   - Enter `2` for two-player mode.
3. In single-player mode, you'll play as "X" against the computer's "O". Make your moves by entering a number from 1 to 9 to place your "X" in the corresponding cell.
4. In two-player mode, take turns between Player X and Player O to make moves.
5. The game will display the current state of the board after each move.
6. The game will announce the winner or declare a draw when the game ends.
